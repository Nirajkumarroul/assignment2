                <h2> PURI</h2>
                <p>Puri is known by several names since the ancient times, and was locally known as "Sri Kshetra" and
                    the Jagannath temple is known as "Badadeula". Puri and the Jagannath Temple were invaded 18 times by
                    Muslim rulers, from the 7th century AD till the early 19th century with the objective of looting the
                    treasures of the temple. Odisha, including Puri and its temple, were part of British India from 1803
                    till India attained independence in August 1947. Even though princely states do not exist in India
                    today, the heirs of the House of Gajapati still perform the ritual duties of the temple. The temple
                    town has many Hindu religious mathas or monasteries.

                    The economy of Puri is dependent on the religious importance of the Jagannath Temple to the extent
                    of nearly 80 percent. The 24 festivals, including 13 major ones, held every year in the temple
                    complex contribute to the economy; Ratha Yatra and its related festivals are the most important
                    which are attended by millions of people every year. Sand art and applique art are some of the
                    important crafts of the city.

                    Puri has been chosen as one of the heritage cities for Heritage City Development and Augmentation
                    Yojana (HRIDAY) scheme of Government of India. </p>
                <h3>PURI TEMPLE</h3>
                <p>The Jagannath Temple is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Jagannath, a form of Sri Krishna in
                    Puri in the state of Odisha on the eastern coast of India. The present temple was rebuilt from the
                    10th century
                    onwards, on the site of an earlier temple, and begun by Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, the first king
                    of the
                    Eastern Ganga dynasty.[1]

                    The Puri temple is famous for its annual Ratha Yatra, or chariot festival, in which the three
                    principal deities
                    are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars. Unlike the stone and metal icons found in
                    most Hindu
                    temples, the image of Jagannath (which gave its name to the English term 'juggernaut') is made of
                    wood and is
                    ceremoniously replaced every twelve or 19 years by an exact replica.[2] It is one of the Char Dham.

                    The temple is sacred to all Hindus, and especially in those of the Vaishnava traditions. Many great
                    Vaishnava
                    saints, such as Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya, Vallabhacharya and Ramananda were
                    closely
                    associated with the temple.[3][4] Ramanuja established the Emar Mutt near the temple and Adi
                    Shankaracharya
                    established the Govardhan Math, which is the seat of one of the four Shankaracharyas. It is also of
                    particular
                    significance to the followers of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, whose founder, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, was
                    attracted to the
                    deity, Jagannath, and lived in Puri for many years.[5][6]

                <h3>SEA BEACH</h3>
                <P> Pilgrims and tourists, nature partisans or adventurers, businessmen or fishermen - Puri has
                    something, and a singular one at that, for everyone. Puri's beaches are internationally acclaimed
                    for their beauty, camouflaged in an ambience of peace and sanctity, inspite of the throng of
                    visitors that animate it. Anytime is good time to go to Puri. Just check out the festival timings if
                    a leisurely vacation is what you are looking for. Else, blending in the sea of chanting pilgrims
                    during the festivals at the Jagannath Temple can be an experience you will remember.</P>
                <H4>Beach festival</H4>
                <p>The Puri Beach Festival (November 23 -27) stands a stark contrast to the religious activities there.
                    Shake a leg yourself or enjoy svelte belles doing it the traditional Oriya way. Besides, this is the
                    best place to load your bags with indegeneous handicraft goodies to carry back home as mementos of
                    an unforgettable vacation. </p>
                <h3>RATHAYATRA

                </h3>
                <P>Puri is the venue for as many as 24 festivals round the year, of which the most popular is the Rath
                    Yatra or the Chariot Festival during June-July, where a 16-wheeled, 45 ft high chariot is pulled by
                    more than 4,000 worshippers amidst a sea of chanting pilgrims. Interestingly, Puri was a seat of the
                    Buddhist culture till it was doused by fervent Vaishnavism. And the Rath Yatra has its parallel with
                    the chariot procession of the Buddha's tooth at Dantapuri.
